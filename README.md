Hello! Here is the Python script I developed the summer 2022 University of California, San Francisco Center
for Intelligent Imaging intern hackathon. In the 24 hour hackathon I train a convolutional neural network
using the efficientnet_b0 archetecture for the binary classification of vertebral spinal fractures from
x-ray images. I cannot share the labels for the test set since they were with held during the hackathon. 
The original data set can divided into a test, validation, and training set if desired.

I hope that this script can act as inspiration or a model to base your own deep learning project on.
